#### System information:

* Inspired by (and much pilfered from): https://github.com/arsho/bottle-bootstrap
* [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/)
* [bottle 0.13-dev](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#installation)

**A few details**

* Requires Python module ``regex``

To install:

 ```
 cd infrared
 ```

then:

 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

* To run, in the same directory type:

 ```

If it starts, it will say something like:

```

Listening on http://localhost:8080/

```

Then visit http://localhost:8080

To stop the server, that is, when you are done using the local web interface, press the ```control`` and ```c``` keys
simultaneiously.
